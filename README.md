# Face Mask Image Classification
## Overview
This is my first image classification project, which I created to practice my deep learning and computer vision skills by using a pre-trained VGG16 model in TenserFlow and Keras to classify an image of a person with and without a face mask.
## Dataset
The dataset that I used in this project is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset
